Download the Hopt App to order (links above), this will secure you a time slot for collection. <br />
You are able to order up to a day in advance, which is highly recommended at weekends as time slots sell fast! <br />
Due to high demand please understand that we are not always able to accommodate phone orders during busy periods. <br />
We are a small operation of two where everything is cooked fresh to order, taking on more than we can chew would compromise the high standard and levels of consistency we aim to deliver.<br />
If you have any allergies or dietary requirements please contact us in advance and we will make every effort to adjust our dishes for you. 
<br /><br />
Collection from ‘Home Taproom’ 61 Tontine Street, Folkestone, CT20 1JR. Short term public highway parking available. <br />
All slots are timed 15 minutes apart to ensure social distancing is maintained. Face masks are currently a legal requirement.
