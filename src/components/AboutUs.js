       We never planned for it to be a permanent thing, it just grew.<br /><br />
The Bao Baron is the product of a partnership between award winning chef and founder, Greig Hughes, and his partner, Daisy Wootton. <br />The Bao Baron began during the first lockdown in March 2020; initially it was only ever going to be a couple of pop-up events to help make ends meet, but demand and feedback was so overwhelming that we just kept going! 
<br /><br />
The Bao Baron takes influences and inspiration from pan-asian cuisine. Our food is prepared using fresh, ethically sourced, local produce. <br />Everything is prepared in house right down to the sauces, and Greig utilizes 17 years of cheffing experience to create delicious, innovative food that reflects the seasons. <br />
We believe that fast food doesn’t have to be poor quality and that good food doesn’t have to carry an exclusive price tag, we want our food to be enjoyed by everyone!
